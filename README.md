Collecting data for my [@top40yearsago] Twitter project.

So far, I've found the Billboard [Hot 100] in a big CSV file. The Canadian charts are available on a government [web site][cancon], but they're all PDF scans. The British charts are available from the [Official Charts Company][brits].

Here are some ideas for topics:
* Top of the chart this week.
* Top of the Canadian or British charts this week.
* Chart debut. (Only for songs that made it to the top? Top 10? Top 40?)
* Enters top 40 or top 10.
* Chart exit.
* Drops out of top 10 or top 40.
* Parody of this week's top song.
* Reenters chart. (With explanation?)

Try to include a youtube or spotify link in each tweet. Try to spread out mentions of the same song.
